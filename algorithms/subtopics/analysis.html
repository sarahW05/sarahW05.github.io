        <p>The analysis of algorithms is an important part of computer science that involes evaluating the performance of different programs or algorithms.<br>
            A program's efficiency can be measured in time(how fast the program runs) or in space(how much memory the algorithm uses). These efficiencies can be measured by different asymptotic notations: <br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Big-O Notation:</strong> Is used to express the upper bound of the algorithm's time/space complexity. Meaning the algorithm should not grow faster than the given complexity.</li>
                <li><strong>Theta-Θ Notation:</strong> This is used to specify both the upper and lower bounds for a given algorithm. It is used as the average time complexity of the program</li>
                <li><strong>Big-Omega Ω Notation:</strong> It specifies what the lower bound of the algorithm is. Meaning the algorithm will grow faster than the given time complexity</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>There are different subtopics within algorithms that you can check out in the links above!</strong></p>
