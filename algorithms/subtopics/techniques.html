        <p>Algorithm techniques is a form of classification for different algorithms. There are multiple different techniques such as: <br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Greedy Method:</strong> Decisions are made to choose the current best option without thinking about the overall outcome</li>
                <li><strong>Divide & Conquer:</strong> Divide the problem into sub-problems and solve them recursively. Then combine all the solutions we have gotten from the subproblems to get the overall answer<br><em>Ex: Merge Sort</em></li>
                <li><strong>Brute Force:</strong> Trying all possible solutions</li>

            </ul>
            <strong>There are different subtopics within algorithms that you can check out in the links above!</strong></p>
