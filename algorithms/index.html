        <p><em>Definition: An algorithm is a set of finite and detailed instructions that is designed complete a task or solve problems.</em></p>
        <p>Algorithms are important when solving issues in different fields such as computer science, mathematics, operations research, artificial intelligence, data science, and more! Algorithms convert processes to automatic operations, which makes them reliable and easier. <br>
            <strong>There are different subtopics within algorithms that you can check out in the links above!</strong></p>
