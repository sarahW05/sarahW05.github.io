            <p>An algorithm can have different approaches and types. Different approaches required different techniques in order to solve the problem in the most optimized way. The most fundamental algorithms are: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Recursive Algorithm:</strong> Based on recursion. A problem is solved by splitting into subproblems and calling itself repeatedly until the problem meets the base condition. <br><em>Ex: Factorial of n, Fibonacci Series, Tower of Hanoi</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Randomized Algorithm:</strong> Use random number to help decide expected outcome.<br><em>Ex: QuickSort - used to select pivot</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Sorting Algorithm:</strong> Sort data in ascending/descending order. It can also be used to arrange data in a useful way. <br><em>Sort examples: Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Selection</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Search Algorithm:</strong> Used to search a specific key in particular data.<br><em>Ex: Binary Search</em></li>
                </ul>
